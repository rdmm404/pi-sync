# pi-sync — Sync Pi settings through Git

`@dbaida/pi-sync` syncs your Pi agent settings across machines using a Git repository.

Use it when you want the same Pi skills, prompts, themes, extensions, keybindings, models, and global instructions on multiple machines without copying files manually. Your configuration is stored as normal Git-tracked files, so you can inspect changes, review history, and restore earlier versions with familiar Git workflows.

## When to use this

Use pi-sync when you want to:

- set up a new machine with your existing Pi configuration
- keep prompts, skills, themes, extensions, and global instructions consistent across machines
- back up Pi agent config in a private Git repo
- review Pi configuration changes through Git history and diffs
- restore an older config version locally without changing the remote repo

## Prerequisites

- Pi coding agent installed.
- `git` installed and available in your shell.
- A **private** Git repository for synced Pi configuration.
- For GitHub HTTPS repositories, GitHub CLI (`gh`) is recommended so Git can reuse your existing GitHub login.

Install GitHub CLI if needed:

```bash
brew install gh
```

Then authenticate and configure Git HTTPS credentials:

```bash
gh auth login
gh auth setup-git
```

SSH repository URLs are also supported, but they require normal SSH key and `ssh-agent` setup.

## Install

Install as a Pi package:

```bash
pi install npm:@dbaida/pi-sync
```

For local development from this repository root:

```bash
pi -e .
```

## Quick start

1. Create a private Git repository for your Pi config.
2. Install the extension:

   ```bash
   pi install npm:@dbaida/pi-sync
   ```

3. In Pi, run:

   ```text
   /pisync init
   ```

4. Enter your repository URL. HTTPS GitHub URLs are recommended if you already use `gh auth login`.
5. Verify setup:

   ```text
   /pisync doctor
   ```

6. On your first machine, publish current config:

   ```text
   /pisync push
   ```

7. On another machine, use the same repository and run:

   ```text
   /pisync pull
   ```

When everything matches, the footer should show:

```text
PI-SYNC: ↑0 ↓0
```

## Configuration

Run inside Pi:

```text
/pisync init
```

The init flow asks for a Git repository URL, branch, and whether auto-sync should be enabled. HTTPS GitHub URLs are recommended because they can reuse an existing GitHub CLI login or Git credential helper without SSH key setup.

The generated local-only file is stored at:

```text
~/.pi/agent/pi-sync.json
```

If `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` is set, pi-sync uses that directory instead of `~/.pi/agent`. Changing `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` is treated as a separate config universe: the config file, `.pisync` state, local Git clone, lock, and backups all live under the resolved Pi dir and are not migrated automatically.

Example:

```json
{
  "repository": "https://github.com/<user>/<repo>.git",
  "branch": "main",
  "autoSync": true,
  "policy": {
    "includeDefaults": true,
    "includePaths": [],
    "excludePaths": ["extensions/work-only"]
  }
}
```

Policy fields are optional:

- `includeDefaults`: defaults to `true`; includes the standard pi-sync files and dirs.
- `includePaths`: extra relative paths under the Pi dir to sync.
- `excludePaths`: relative paths under the Pi dir to skip; excludes win over includes.

Use blacklist mode by keeping `includeDefaults: true` and adding excludes. Use whitelist mode by setting `includeDefaults: false` and listing only the paths you want in `includePaths`.

For GitHub HTTPS repositories, `/pisync init` can optionally run `gh auth setup-git` after confirming with you. This lets Git reuse your existing GitHub CLI login. SSH URLs still require normal SSH key and ssh-agent setup.

Environment overrides are also supported: `PI_SYNC_REPOSITORY` (or `PI_SYNC_REPO`), `PI_SYNC_BRANCH`, and `PI_SYNC_AUTO_SYNC`. Run `/pisync doctor` after setup to verify repository access and get auth-specific guidance.

## Commands

```text
/pisync config
/pisync doctor
/pisync status [--verbose]
/pisync diff
/pisync push
/pisync pull
/pisync sync
/pisync history
/pisync checkout <commit-ish>
/pisync unlock --stale
```

Command guide:

| Command                         | Use it when                                                           |
| ------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `/pisync init`                  | Configure pi-sync for this machine.                                   |
| `/pisync doctor`                | Verify config, Git access, secret scan, and lock status.              |
| `/pisync status [--verbose]`    | Check local/remote drift and optionally list changed paths.           |
| `/pisync diff`                  | Review textual differences before pushing or pulling.                 |
| `/pisync push`                  | Publish local Pi settings to the Git repo.                            |
| `/pisync pull`                  | Apply remote Git settings locally after backup and confirmation.      |
| `/pisync sync`                  | Conservatively push or pull when only one side changed.               |
| `/pisync history`               | Show recent synced Git commits.                                       |
| `/pisync checkout <commit-ish>` | Restore a previous commit locally without changing the remote branch. |
| `/pisync unlock --stale`        | Remove a stale local lock after confirming no sync is running.        |

Useful flags:

- `--yes` / `-y`: skip confirmation prompts.
- `--force`: allow push/pull when both local and remote state changed.
- `--verbose` / `-v`: show changed paths for `/pisync status`.
- `--stale`: remove a stale local lock.

Press Tab after `/pisync ` to autocomplete subcommands with short descriptions.

## Footer status

pi-sync shows drift in the footer:

```text
PI-SYNC: ↑1 ↓0
```

- `↑` means local output changes that are not pushed.
- `↓` means remote input changes that are not pulled.

Common states:

| Status  | Meaning                | Next step                                                                    |
| ------- | ---------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `↑0 ↓0` | Local and remote match | Nothing                                                                      |
| `↑1 ↓0` | Local files changed    | `/pisync diff`, then `/pisync push`                                          |
| `↑0 ↓1` | Remote changed         | `/pisync pull`                                                               |
| `↑1 ↓1` | Both changed           | `/pisync diff`, then choose `/pisync pull --force` or `/pisync push --force` |

## What is synced

The extension syncs allowlisted files from the resolved Pi agent directory into the root of the configured Git repo. By default, this is `~/.pi/agent`:

```text
settings.json
keybindings.json
models.json
AGENTS.md
skills/
prompts/
themes/
extensions/
```

It excludes `.env*`, `node_modules`, `.git`, `.pisync`, `pi-sync.json`, and paths containing `secret` or `token`, and it refuses to push common API-key patterns. Policy excludes are applied in addition to those hard safety denies. `/pisync diff` and confirmation prompts use textual `git diff --no-index` output between remote files and local files.

### Settings and packages

`settings.json` is sanitized before sync and merged on pull:

- `lastChangelogVersion` is stripped from synced settings.
- Portable package sources are synced, including npm package names, `npm:`, `git:`, HTTPS Git URLs, and SSH Git URLs.
- Relative local paths are synced only when they stay inside the Pi dir and point at policy-included paths.
- Absolute paths, `~` paths, `file:` paths, and paths escaping the Pi dir are treated as machine-local and preserved locally during pulls.

If one machine adds a portable npm/git package to synced settings, another machine receives the settings entry on pull. Pi installs/loads missing remote packages during reload or startup; pi-sync itself updates settings and prompts for reload.

### Current limitations

- Named profiles are not supported yet. Use policy includes/excludes or separate `PI_CODING_AGENT_DIR` values for now.
- Conflict UX is intentionally unchanged. Use `/pisync status --verbose` or `/pisync diff`, then resolve manually with `/pisync push --force` or `/pisync pull --force`.

## Safety

- Use a private Git repository for synced Pi config.
- Local state, clone cache, locks, and backups live under the resolved Pi dir's `.pisync/` directory.
- Pull and checkout create local backups before changing files.
- Pull and checkout apply normal Git-tracked files while still preflighting paths.
- Symlinks are warned about and skipped. pi-sync does not follow symlinks, overwrite symlink targets, or write/delete through symlinked parents.
- Checkout restores a previous commit locally without changing the remote branch; use `/pisync push` afterwards only if you want to publish that checked-out state as a new commit.
- Auto-sync is enabled by default but never pushes local changes automatically; it only pulls safe remote changes or asks you to resolve conflicts manually.
- Secret scanning is best-effort. Do not intentionally store API keys or tokens in synced Pi config.
